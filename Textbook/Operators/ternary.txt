We can easily implement a condition expression using ternary operator. The following example demonstrates this âˆ’

Example
condition expression ? statement1 : statement2
When the condition expression returns true, statement1 gets executed; otherwise statement2 is executed. For instance, the following example finds the largest number from two given numbers.

Example
awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b = 20; (a > b) ? max = a : max = b; print "Max =", max}'
